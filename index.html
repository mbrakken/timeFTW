<a name="vision" class="anchor" href="#vision"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Vision</h2>

<p><em>A network of communities seeking economic and social empowerment and sustainability through cooperation, mutualism, and the broad recognition of local resources and human value in defining their wealth and meeting their needs.</em></p>

<h2>
<a name="mission" class="anchor" href="#mission"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mission</h2>

<p><em>Implement an integrated online and offline framework to encourage inclusive and empowering involvement in community problem-solving, document activity and involvement to share credit and knowledge broadly, and promote sharing, reciprocity, and other systems of cooperative economics to redesign work around our individual and shared passions.</em></p>

<p>TimeFTW wants to assist communities in diverse locales, around the world, in their problem solving efforts by sharing project experiences in a structured process-oriented manner. TimeFTW is designed to prototype, test, evaluate and actively share tools and knowledge, bringing these systems to scale by promoting their replication in communities worldwide.</p>

<p>We believe the concept is simple: (1) identify problems or needs in our communities; (2) bring together people and other assets that could be used towards a solution; (3) construct that solution in an open and accessible manner; (4) catalogue investments, outcomes, and value creation the whole time; (5) share everything.</p>

<p>We are creating an open platform, buildFTW.org, where this process becomes real by people communicating, sharing, and learning from the efforts of other people, while facilitating community projects in their communities. We also encourage techniques that incorporate and foster a broader outlook on value, resource, and wealth by separating projects from any single resource or revenue model, freeing them from depending on dollars as the only or primary resource.</p>

<p>To that end we intend to create an employment model for our own internal use, then to disseminate elsewhere, where time and compensation are accounted for much more explicitly and encompass a much broader array of items than is standard. For example, participants will identify which monetary expenses can be lowered by creating cooperative structures or supports - i.e. educational needs may be met with timebank hours, energy costs may be reduced through participation in a conservation cooperative, health care costs may be reduced through participation in a health-oriented community saving and lending scheme - and will be encouraged to spend work time creating said supports. We will provide technical assistance for the cost-saving measures, development of the cooperative structures, and additional fundraising. Through this method we intend to grow our work capacity far beyond what $135,000 would normally buy.</p>
